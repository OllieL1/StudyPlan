# StudyPlan

A quick single page website for tracking my revision. Only runs locally on my machine.

## Setup Guide for Forking
(Untested) - I will properly test this after the exam diet is finished (> 23rd May 2025).
- Change the list of subjects in Lines \[0,9\] in `progress.js`.
- This should tailor the site to your subjects. 
- Everything is saved in `localStorage`

Long term goal is to add a database and accounts, then host the site to avoid the need for local hosting and remove the risk of `localStorage` - plus increase loading speed of pages.
